The dict type is not only widely used in our programs but also a fundamental part of
the Python implementation. Module namespaces, class and instance attributes, and
function keyword arguments are some of the fundamental constructs where dictionaries
are deployed. The built-in functions live in __builtins__.__dict__.
Because of their crucial role, Python dicts are highly optimized. Hash tables are the
engines behind Pythonâ€™s high-performance dicts.
